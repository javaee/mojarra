/**
 * A class for handling state insertion.  Content is written
 * directly to "out" until an attempt to write state;  at that
 * point, it's redirected into a buffer that can be picked through
 * in theory, this buffer should be very small, since it only
 * needs to be enough to contain all the content after the close
 * of the first (and, hopefully, only) form.
 * <p>
 * Potential optimizations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If we created a new FastWriter at each call to writingState(),
 * and stored a List of them, then we'd know that state tokens could
 * only possibly be near the start of each buffer (and might not be there
 * at all).  (There might be a close-element before the state token). Then,
 * we'd only need to check the start of the buffer for the state token;
 * if it's there, write out the real state, then blast the rest of the
 * buffer out.  This wouldn't even require toString(), which for
 * large buffers is expensive.  However, this optimization is only
 * going to be especially meaningful for the multi-form case.
 * </li>
 * <li>More of a FastWriter optimization than a StateWriter, but:
 *  it is far faster to create a set of small 1K buffers than constantly
 *  reallocating one big buffer.</li>
 * </ul>
