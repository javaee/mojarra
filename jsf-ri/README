This README documents the Sun Reference implementation (RI) for JSR 127,
JavaServer (tm) Faces.

Installation Notes
==================

JavaServer (tm) Faces is intended to run in a Servlet 2.3, JSP 1.2 web
container, such as that distributed with Java Web Services Developer
Pack <http://java.sun.com/webservices/webservicespack.html>.  Please
follow the instructions for your container and have it working well in
your environment before continuing with these installation notes.

To use JavaServer (tm) Faces in your own webapp, you need to follow the
online documentation at <http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/>.
Make sure to include all the jars in the lib directory of this
distribution in your WEB-INF/lib directory in your webapp.  

Major changes/features in this release:
=======================================

Here are the changes since the 1.0 release

* Tag Library Validation in the html_basic taglib is disabled by
  default.  To enable it set the
  "com.sun.faces.enableHtmlTagLibValidator" ServletContext init param to
  true in your web.xml, like this:

    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.sun.faces.enableHtmlTagLibValidator</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>



Logging support and configuration steps
=======================================
JavaServer Faces Reference Implementation in this release leverages the 
Jakarta Commons logging API to provide logging functionality. We have followed 
the guidelines recommended by 
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/userguide.html.
JavaServer Faces Reference Implementation can be configured to provide
logging information using the steps below.

step 1.
If you are using Tomcat or JWSDP as your container, you can set the following 
property to tell the container what logging implementation you are using
as well as the location of your logging configuration file. 
set CATALINA_OPTS=-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger -Djava.util.logging.config.file=D:\Files_2k\j2sdk1.4.1_03\jre\lib\jsf-log.properties

step 2.
We have shown a sample logging configuration file below that is configured to
get logging output when you are running a JavaServer Faces application. 
The default JDK 1.4 logging configuration file is 
"$JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/logging.properties". You can either manipulate that as per
directions below, in which case it's global to all Java apps that you run
or you can create a jsf.log properties as illustrated below. You can change 
the "java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern" property to control
where your logging information is written.

Here's the jsf-log.properties
############################################################
#  	Default Logging Configuration File
# http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html#1.2
# You can use a different file by specifying a filename
# with the java.util.logging.config.file system property.  
# For example java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=myfile
############################################################

############################################################
#  	Global properties
############################################################

# "handlers" specifies a comma separated list of log Handler 
# classes.  These handlers will be installed during VM startup.
# Note that these classes must be on the system classpath.
# By default we only configure a ConsoleHandler, which will only
# show messages at the INFO and above levels.

# To also add the FileHandler, use the following line instead.
handlers= java.util.logging.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Default global logging level.
# This specifies which kinds of events are logged across
# all loggers.  For any given facility this global level
# can be overriden by a facility specific level
# Note that the ConsoleHandler also has a separate level
# setting to limit messages printed to the console.
#.level= INFO
.level= INFO

############################################################
# Handler specific properties.
# Describes specific configuration info for Handlers.
############################################################

# default file output is in user's home directory.
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = %h/java%u.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit = 50000
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count = 1
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.XMLFormatter

# Limit the message that are printed on the console to INFO and above.
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = INFO
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter


############################################################
# Facility specific properties.
# Provides extra control for each logger.
############################################################

# For example, set the com.xyz.foo logger to only log SEVERE
# messages:
com.xyz.foo.level = SEVERE
com.sun.faces.level = ALL

If you use the ConsoleHandler ( which would direct all the output to catalina.out 
in the case of standalone Tomcat or launcher.server.log in the case of JWSDP )
please make sure that the detail level for ConsoleHandler can handle the level set
for individual packages. For example say you have set the level for 
"com.sun.faces.el" package to "FINEST" as below.
    "com.sun.faces.el.level = FINEST"

You won't see any trace or debug messages unless you also set 
ConsoleHandler.level = FINEST. ConsoleHandler.level caps the detail level to the 
console, no matter what the underlying loggers are set for.

In this release, the Reference Implementation provides logging support for the
following packges.
    * com.sun.faces.application
    * com.sun.faces.el
    * com.sun.faces.lifecycle

The logging messages are not localized. Localisation as 
well as logging for rest of the RI will be done in a future release.

Known Issues With This Release
==============================

* The Map returned by the UIComponent.getAttributes() method implements 
  get() so that if you ask for a key that is implemented as a property, 
  you get the property value. However, if you call iterator() on the Map, 
  you will get an Iterator that iterates over the "real" attributes only, 
  not the properties.

* When authoring a page that uses a UISelectOne or UISelectOne component
  that is backed by a value reference expression that points to a
  primitive type, a default selected value must be included in the
  configured values for the component.  This is because there is no way
  to express "null" using primitive values.  Remember, you can't use "0"
  to express null, because "0" is a valid value.

* the value of javax.faces.component.NamingContainer.SEPARATOR_CHAR is
  ':'.  This means that the client id for components will be something
  like "form:checkbox1".  The use of the ':' character in the id causes
  problems for CSS stylesheets that try to apply style to components
  using their id.  The workaround is to use the CSS "class" concept to
  apply style to a component.

* When saving state on the server, there is no way for the server to
  know that a view has expired.  Thus, if the JSP page changes between
  requests, it's possible there will be inconsistencies between the
  restored tree and the JSP page.  Therefore, if you change the JSP
  page, you need to re-start the browser so that the session is lost.

  In related news, the number of views saved in the session when the
  application is configured to save state in the server is configurable
  by the RI init context parameter
  "com.sun.faces.NUMBER_OF_VIEWS_IN_SESSION" without quotes.  This is a
  non-standard feature, so don't count on it.

* Don't use the '.' character in ResourceBundle keys for use in Faces.
  This character is a reserved character in the JSF EL.

* When deploying on a non-JWSDP container, you must include all the
  dependent jars in your webapp's WEB-INF/lib directory.  It's possible
  it may work without doing this, but this is not a supported
  configuration.

* If you're using a tomcat 4 series container, or any container that
  strictly conforms to JSP1.1, Servlet 2.3, you must use JSTL 1.0
  instead of JSTL 1.1.

* The non-jsp demo does not deploy under tomcat 4.1.29.  

* Some web containers don't follow the Servlet 2.3 Spec rule of calling
  ServletContextListeners listeners defined in tld files in the META-INF
  directory of a jar. Running a faces webapp in such a container
  requires you to manually declare the ServletContextListener.  The
  listener-class you need to specify is

  com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener

* "disabledClass" property specified on SelectOneRadio tag is not applied
  to the individual select item  (options). 

* If you're using component bindings pointing to beans stored in session
  scope with values initialized from the JSP page, you may run into some
  difficulties in the "edit-compile-debug" cycle.

  Consider this JSP fragment:

  <h:commandButton binding="#{backingBean.button1}" value="press me" />

  Let's say that "backingBean" is stored in session scope.  The first
  time the browser views this page, backingBean gets instantiated, and
  initialized with the value "press me".  Now, let's say the web-app is
  being authored in place, on the web container.  In other words, any
  changes made to the JSP are seen "live" on the server.  If you change
  the JSP to alter the value of the button to be different, say like
  this:

  <h:commandButton binding="#{backingBean.button1}" value="click me" />

  and save the page, then re-load the page in the browser, you'll see
  that the button still shows up with the old label, "press me".  This
  is because the spec is designed to only initialize the backing bean
  with a value the first time the page is loaded, and the bean is still
  sitting in the session with the old value.  There are several
  workarounds to this problem.

  1. use "request" or "none" scope for your backing bean

  2. use java code to push the value into the bean, rather than JSP

  3. ask the user to re-start their browser after modifying the JSP
     page.

  4. find a way to invalidate the session when the JSP page has changed.
