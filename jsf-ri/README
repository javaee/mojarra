This README documents the Sun Reference implementation (RI) for JSR 127,
JavaServer (tm) Faces.

jsf-api cvs tag for this implementation: JSF_API_20031110_BETA
jsf-api-spec for this implementation: <JSF_SPEC_PFD.pdf>

Installation Notes
==================

JavaServer (tm) Faces is intended to run in a Servlet 2.3, JSP 1.2 web
container, such as that distributed with Java Web Services Developer
Pack <http://java.sun.com/webservices/webservicespack.html>.  Please
follow the instructions for your container and have it working well in
your environment before continuing with these installation notes.

To use JavaServer (tm) Faces in your own webapp, you need to follow the
online documentation at <http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/>.
Make sure to include all the jars in the lib directory of this
distribution in your WEB-INF/lib directory in your webapp.  

Major changes/features in this release:
=======================================

There have been many changes since the EA4 release of JavaServer
technology. Here are the major ones that really stand out.  Section
numbers refer to the spec.

UIComponent Hierarchy Shuffling
===============================

The component hierararchy has changed a bit, again.

Please see Chapter 3 "User Interface Component Model". Section 4.1
"Standard User Interface Components" includes a diagram of the component
package.  

Note that we have introduced five "behaviorial" interfaces as described
in this table:

interface name	behavioral purpose
ActionSource	implemented by components that can emit ActionEvents

NamingContainer implemented by components that require all their
                children to be named uniquely

StateHolder	implemented by components and other objects that need to 
                save and restore their state between requests

ValueHolder	implemented by components that have a value

ConvertibleValueHolder	implemented by component that have a value that 
                        is subject to type conversion


These interfaces encapsulate the various behaviors of the classes.

Bypass validation and model updates
===================================

It is now possible to cause the page submit to bypass the validation and
model update phases by setting the "immediate" property of UICommand
which causes the page submit to be true. This is useful for situations
such as "cancel" buttons.

Please see Section 3.2.1.1 "Properties".

Concrete HTML component classes
===============================

To enable tools to deliver "component pallete" type interfaces, a new
package of UIComponent subclasses has been introduced. These componets
simply combine the notion of component and renderer for all the
supported combinations of component and renderer.

Please Section 8.6 "The concrete HTML component classes".

Flexible way to map to FacesServlet
===============================

It is no longer required to use /faces/* as the url-mapping for faces
webapps. You can now use any prefix or extension mapping.

Please see Section 10.1.2 "Servlet Mapping".

ResopnseWriter changes
======================

Most of the methods on the ResponseWriter class now take an additonal
argument that will allow tool vendors to gain information at design time
about the correspondence between page elements and UIComponent
instances.

Please see Section 6.1.6 "ResponseStream and ResponseWriter".

New value binding mechanism
===========================

Nearly all component properties can now be either a literal value, or
get their value from a ValueBinding. This enables lots of flexibility
for configuring your components. Here’s a JSP example:

<h:input_text value="default value" />

<h:output_text value="#{requestScope.username}" />

<h:command_button value="#{localizedBundle.buyLabel}" />

The first shows a literal value, the second looking into the scoped
namespace with the requestScope implicit object, and the third using the
cascading lookup mechanism to find a bean that answers to the name
localizedBundle.

We no longer have two separate attributes, value and valueRef, just one
value attribute that serves both purposes. We have also introduced a new
delimiter syntax #{}. This was necessary to prevent the JSP 2.0 page
engine from interpreting the expression before we it made sense to do
so.

Please see Section 5.1 "Value Binding Expressions".

New method binding mechanism
============================

It is now possible to refer directly to a method in a JavaBean
accessible in the scoped namespace for things like button press events,
and value change events. The following attributes accept method binding
expressions

action

actionListener

validate

valueChangeListener

Please see Section 5.2 "Method Binding Expressions".

Component reference mechanism
=============================

It is now possible to have the components in the view reside as
properties of an arbitrary JavaBean. This would be useful, combined with
the aforementioned value and method binding mechanims, if you wanted to
have a JavaBean that stands behind each page in your webapp. Here's a
couple of JSP examples:

  <h:selectone_menu styleClass="optionValue"
                       binding="#{carstore.currentModel.engine}"/>

  <h:command_button binding="#{carstore.buyButton}"
                     action="#{carstore.curBuyAction}"/>

Here we are saying that the actual UISelectOne instance that stands
behind this menu widget in the page is returned by invoking the
getEngine() method on the bean returned by evaluating the expression
carstore.currentModel and that the actual UICommand component is
returned from the getBuyButton() method of that same bean.  If the
getter method returns null, the tag will create a component instance
(as usual) and call your setter method.  With either alternative, you
can now manipulate the component instance programmatically in your
backing bean.

Please see Section 3.1.3 "Component Reference Expressions".

Maps and Lists in the faces-config file
=======================================

It is now possible to have java.util.Map and java.util.List entries
directly as managed beans in the faces-config file. It is also possible
to configure these entities with the existing configuration syntax.

Please see Section 5.3.1.2 "Default VariableResolver Implementation".

State Saving mechanism
======================

We provide automated saving of the component state between requests. The
application author can choose to have the state saved in the client or
on the server. The mechanism supports having multiple forms in the page,
but having the state of the entire page be restored.

Please see Section 2.5.2 "State Management".

Including JSP pages with <jsp:include> or <c:import>
====================================================

It is now possible to include JSP pages using either of the above tags.

Please see Section 9.5.7 "<f:subview>".

Localization mechanism
======================

We now support ResourceBundle based localization for all component
attributes. In addition, we conform to JSP, JSTL, and Servlet best
practices for character encoding and Locale support.

Please see Section 2.5.1 "Localization and Internationalization
(L10N/I18N)".

Adapter pattern for pluggable Factory classes
=============================================

Several classes in the API have always been pluggable by providing a
factory for those classes. It is now possible to have the pluggable
imelementation get access to the previously installed
implementation. This allows one to override just a subset of the
functionality, without having to subclass or re-implement
everything. Please see the javadocs for the javax.faces.FactoryFinder
class.

New hyperlink component/renderer combinations
=============================================

The <h:command_hyperlink> tag has been replaced by the <h:output_link>
and <h:command_link> tags. The former is for linking to other pages
without doing a post back. The latter is just like a <h:command_button>
except that the label comes from nested content, and the result shows up
to the user as a hyperlink.

Please see Section 8.5.1 "Renderer Types for UICommand Components" and
Section 8.5.6 "Renderer Types for UIOutput Components".

Event mechanism implementation changes
======================================

Most of the event firing and litener invocation mechanism is implemented
in the API classes. This implementation has changed dramatically since
EA4, but there is minimal change on the usage model.

Also, any occurrence of valuechanged, as in valuechanged-listener,
ValueChangedListener, etc has been changed to valuechange. That is,
there is no "ed". This is for parity with JavaBeans.

Please see Section 3.4.7 "Event Broadcasting".

New UIData component and Table Renderer
=======================================

This release introduces a powerful, flexible, way to show data in a
Table given a number of data sources.

Please see Section 4.1.3 "UIData" and Section 8.5.2 "Renderer Types for
UIData Components".There have been many changes since the EA4 release of
JavaServer technology. Here are the major ones that really stand out.

Logging support and configuration steps
=======================================
JavaServer Faces Reference Implementation in this release leverages the 
Jakarta Commons logging API to provide logging functionality. We have followed 
the guidelines recommended by 
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/userguide.html.
JavaServer Faces Reference Implementation can be configured to provide
logging information using the steps below.

step 1.
If you are using Tomcat or JWSDP as your container, you can set the following 
property to tell the container what logging implementation you are using
as well as the location of your logging configuration file. 
set CATALINA_OPTS=-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger -Djava.util.logging.config.file=D:\Files_2k\j2sdk1.4.1_03\jre\lib\jsf-log.properties

step 2.
We have shown a sample logging configuration file below that is configured to
get logging output when you are running a JavaServer Faces application. 
The default JDK 1.4 logging configuration file is 
"$JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/logging.properties". You can either manipulate that as per
directions below, in which case it's global to all Java apps that you run
or you can create a jsf.log properties as illustrated below. You can change 
the "java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern" property to control
where your logging information is written.

Here's the jsf-log.properties
############################################################
#  	Default Logging Configuration File
# http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html#1.2
# You can use a different file by specifying a filename
# with the java.util.logging.config.file system property.  
# For example java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=myfile
############################################################

############################################################
#  	Global properties
############################################################

# "handlers" specifies a comma separated list of log Handler 
# classes.  These handlers will be installed during VM startup.
# Note that these classes must be on the system classpath.
# By default we only configure a ConsoleHandler, which will only
# show messages at the INFO and above levels.

# To also add the FileHandler, use the following line instead.
handlers= java.util.logging.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Default global logging level.
# This specifies which kinds of events are logged across
# all loggers.  For any given facility this global level
# can be overriden by a facility specific level
# Note that the ConsoleHandler also has a separate level
# setting to limit messages printed to the console.
#.level= INFO
.level= INFO

############################################################
# Handler specific properties.
# Describes specific configuration info for Handlers.
############################################################

# default file output is in user's home directory.
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = %h/java%u.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit = 50000
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count = 1
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.XMLFormatter

# Limit the message that are printed on the console to INFO and above.
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = INFO
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter


############################################################
# Facility specific properties.
# Provides extra control for each logger.
############################################################

# For example, set the com.xyz.foo logger to only log SEVERE
# messages:
com.xyz.foo.level = SEVERE
com.sun.faces.level = ALL

If you use the ConsoleHandler ( which would direct all the output to catalina.out 
in the case of standalone Tomcat or launcher.server.log in the case of JWSDP )
please make sure that the detail level for ConsoleHandler can handle the level set
for individual packages. For example say you have set the level for 
"com.sun.faces.el" package to "FINEST" as below.
    "com.sun.faces.el.level = FINEST"

You won't see any trace or debug messages unless you also set 
ConsoleHandler.level = FINEST. ConsoleHandler.level caps the detail level to the 
console, no matter what the underlying loggers are set for.

In this release, the Reference Implementation provides logging support for the
following packges.
    * com.sun.faces.application
    * com.sun.faces.el
    * com.sun.faces.lifecycle

The logging messages are not localized. Localisation as 
well as logging for rest of the RI will be done in a future release.

Known Issues With This Release
==============================

* When authoring a page that uses a UISelectOne component that is backed
  by a value reference expression that points to a primitive type, a
  default selected value default selected value must be included in the
  configured values for the component.  This is because there is no way
  to express "null" using primitive values.  Remember, you can't use "0"
  to express null, because "0" is a valid value.

* the value of javax.faces.component.NamingContainer.SEPARATOR_CHAR is
  ':'.  This means that the client id for components will be something
  like "form:checkbox1".  The use of the ':' character in the id causes
  problems for CSS stylesheets that try to apply style to components
  using their id.  The workaround is to use the CSS "class" concept to
  apply style to a component.

* When saving state on the server, there is no way for the server to
  know that a view has expired.  Thus, if the JSP page changes between
  requests, it's possible there will be inconsistencies between the
  restored tree and the JSP page.  Therefore, if you change the JSP
  page, you need to re-start the browser so that the session is lost.

  In related news, the number of views saved in the session when the
  application is configured to save state in the server is configurable
  by the RI init context parameter
  "com.sun.faces.NUMBER_OF_VIEWS_IN_SESSION" without quotes.  This is a
  non-standard feature, so don't count on it.

* Don't use the '.' character in ResourceBundle keys for use in Faces.
  This character is a reserved character in the JSF EL.

* When deploying on a non-JWSDP container, you must include all the
  dependent jars in your webapp's WEB-INF/lib directory.  It's possible
  it may work without doing this, but this is not a supported
  configuration.

* If you're using a tomcat 4 series container, you must use JSTL 1.0
  instead of JSTL 1.1.

* UIData children that do not use VB expressions fail to maintain their
  values.  In other words, if you have a literal value in a child of a
  UIData component, that value will be lost on postback.  Workaround:
  always use a VB expression with the value attribute for UIData
  children.

* UIComponent.broadcast() fails to throw IllegalStateException if passed
  invalid Parameter.

  From the javadocs of UIComponent.broadcast():

  <quote> java.lang.IllegalStateException - if PhaseId.ANY_PHASE is
  passed for the phase identifier </quote>

  No exception is currently thrown by the RI.

* UIInput.validate() does not store zero-length String into previous property.

* Incorrect type conversion for UISelectMany

  This class doesn't properly deal with conversion for primitives.
  Workaround: use wrapper classes instead of primitives for model objects.

* Renderers in the Standard HTML RenderKit are fragile in terms of their
  support for rendered="false" on children and facets.  Specific known issues
  include:
  - GridRenderer emits <td></td> for a child component that is
    set to rendered="false".
  - TableRenderer ignores rendered="false" on child UIColumn components.
  - All renderers that deal with facets are currently ignoring rendered=false
    on the facet components.

* The non-jsp demo does not deploy under tomcat 4.1.29.  

Major changes
==============

* prefix named things with javax.faces

* Change how renderers are looked up.  Every component now has two
  properties to locate an appropriate Renderer: componentFamily, and
  rendererType.  This change allows a clean separation for components
  that can have multiple renderer types, such as UICommand with Link or
  Button renderers, or renderer types that can handle multiple
  components, such as the text renderer rendering UIOutput or UIInput
  components.

  RenderKit.getRenderer() is now:

  public abstract Renderer getRenderer(String family, String rendererType);

  Please see the javadocs for more information.

* the render-kit-id for the default RenderKit is not HTML_BASIC

* a validator signals that validation has failed by throwning an
  ValidationException.  Also, the signature for Validator.validate() has
  changed.

* JSFA162

* Change in value handling, validation, and timing of Conversion

  => PENDING(edburns): move this into a new sub-section in 2.5 of the spec.

  This change only impacts faces implementation providers and advanced
  custom component authors.  This changes is transparent to page authors.

  Remove the class ConvertibleValueHolder.  Note that anything that has
  a value that could possibly be interesting to the model tier is liable
  for conversion.  Thus, the notion of having a converter has been moved
  up to the root ValueHolder interface.

  Introduce interface EditableValueHolder extends ValueHolder.  This
  defines the contract for things that are have values that can be
  changed by the user.  As such, it supports listeners and validators. 

  => Please see PENDING(edburns): add getConvertedValue() to Renderer
  description in spec.

  Here's how values get moved from the page (after entry by the user,
  for example) to the components, and possibly to the model tier.  This
  description assumes the JSP/HTTP case, where all components have
  Renderers.

    Apply Request Values Phase

      The user presses a button that causes a form submit to occurr.
      This causes the state of the form to be sent as name=value pairs
      in the POST data of the request.  The faces request processing
      lifecycle is entered, and eventually we come to the Apply Request
      Values phase.  In this phase, the decode() method for each
      renderer for each component in the view is called.  The renderer
      takes the value from the request and passes it to the
      setSubmittedValue of the component, which is, of course, an
      instance of EditableValueHolder.  If the component has the
      "immediate" property set to true, we execute validation
      immediately after decoding.  See below for what happens when we
      execute validation.

    Process Validators Phase

      If the immediate property is not set, we execute validation

    Executing Validation

      Please see the javadocs for UIInput.validate() for more details,
      but basically, this method gets the submitted value from the
      component (set during Apply Request Values), gets renderer for the
      component and calls its getConvertedValue(), passing the submitted
      value.  If a conversion error occurs, it is dealt with as
      described in the spec.  Otherwise, all validators attached to the
      component are asked to validate the converted value.  If any
      validation errors occur, they are dealt with as described in the
      spec.  The converted value is pushed into the component's
      setValue() method, and a ValueChangeEvent is fired if the value
      has changed).

    Update Model Values Phase

      For each UIInput component in the view, its updateModel() method
      is called.  This method only takes action if a local value was set
      when validation executed.  If the page author configured this
      component to push its value to the model tier, this pushing
      happens here.  Any errors that occurr as a result of the attempt
      to push the value to the model tier are dealt with as described in
      the spec.

* camelCasing of tags

* removal of "method" and "action" attrs from <h:form>  

* removal of "onclick" for <h:commandLink>.

* Allowing mixed literals and EL in a JSF EL expression.  Allow full JSP
  2.0 eval syntax and operators in JSF EL.

* JSF Works with Tiles.

* ValueBinding instances are no longer cached in the application.  This
  means Application.getValueBinding() has been replaced with
  Application.createValueBinding().

* generation of "id" attribute in rendered markup.

* ValueHolder re-shuffling

* UICommand doesn't add the default ActionListener to itself, it just
  calls Application.getActionListener().

* When using <f:loadBundle> trying to access a resource that happens to
  be missing from the ResourceBundle yields ???key???.

* UIMessage changes

    UIMessages no longer has a "for" property

    > 3. Change the defaults of "showSummary" and "showDetail" to be:
    >
    >                 UIMessage     UIMessages
    >   showSummary     false         true
    >   showDetail      true          false
    >
    >   Relative to the current spec, this flips the defaults for UIMessage,
    >   and means that if you use UIMessages up top and UIMessage next to
    >   the component, you'll get a summary of all error messages up top,
    >   and detailed explanations below.
    >
    Done.

    >   This proposal does imply that developers (including the spec) should
    >   be providing both summaries and details for their error messages.
    >
    Modified FacesMessage such that the "detail" property will be the same
    as the "summary" property unless it was set to something explicitly
    different.  This seems more user friendly to me.

* StateManager is now a property of the Application, rather than the
  RenderKit.  It also can be configurable in the faces-config.xml

* Decorator pattern for things in the application.  In addition to what
  you have in the FacesConfig.xml

  
* Some web containers don't follow the Servlet 2.3 Spec rule of calling
  ServletContextListeners listeners defined in tld files in the META-INF
  directory of a jar. Running a faces webapp in such a container
  requires you to manually declare the ServletContextListener.  The
  listener-class you need to specify is

  com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener
