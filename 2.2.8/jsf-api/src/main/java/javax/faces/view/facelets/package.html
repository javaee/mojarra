<title>Package Description for "javax.faces.view.facelets"</title>

<body bgcolor="white">

<p class="changed_added_2_0"><span class="changed_modified_2_0_rev_a
changed_modified_2_1 changed_modified_2_2">This</span> package contains public classes for
the Java code API of Facelets.  The vast majority of Facelets users have
no need to access the Java API and can get all their work done using the
tag-level API.  These classes are provided for users that have a need
for a Java API that allows participation in the execution of a Facelets
View, which happens as a result of the runtime calling <a
href="../ViewDeclarationLanguage.html#buildView(javax.faces.context.FacesContext,%20javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot)"><code>ViewDeclarationLanguage.buildView()</code></a>.

</p>

<p>The most common usecase for participating in the execution of a
Facelets View is to provide a custom tag handler in those cases when the
non-Java API methods for doing so is not sufficient.  In such cases,
Java classes may extend from <code><a
href="ComponentHandler.html">ComponentHandler</a></code>, <code><a
href="BehaviorHandler.html">BehaviorHandler</a></code>, <code><a
href="ConverterHandler.html">ConverterHandler</a></code>, or <code><a
href="ValidatorHandler.html">ValidatorHandler</a></code> depending upon
the kind of JSF Java API artifact they want to represent in the Facelets
VDL page.</p>
