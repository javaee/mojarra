 *
 * <div class="changed_added_2_0">
 *
 * <p class="javadocSection">Packaging Resources</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *  <p>ResourceHandler defines a path based packaging convention for
 *  resources.  The default implementation of
 *  <code>ResourceHandler</code> must support packaging resources in the
 *  classpath or in the web application root. See section JSF.2.6.1 of the
 *  spec prose document <a
 *  href="../../../overview-summary.html#prose_document">linked in the
 *  overview summary</a> for the normative specification of packaging
 *  resources.</p>

 * <p>Briefly, The default implementation must support packaging
 * resources in the web application root under the path</p>
 *
 * <p><code>resources/&lt;resourceIdentifier&gt;</code></p>
 *
 * <p>relative to the web app root.  <span
 * class="changed_added_2_2">"resources" is the default location, but
 * this location can be changed by the value of the {@link
 * #WEBAPP_RESOURCES_DIRECTORY_PARAM_NAME}
 * <code>&lt;context-param&gt;</code>.</span></p>
 *
 * <p>For the default implementation, resources packaged in the
 * classpath must reside under the JAR entry name</p>

 * <p><code>META-INF/resources/&lt;resourceIdentifier&gt;</code></p>

 * <div class="changed_added_2_2">

 * <p>In the case of Faces Flows packaged
 * within jar files, resources packaged in the classpath must reside
 * under the jar entry name</p>

 * <p><code>META-INF/flows/&lt;resourceIdentifier&gt;</code></p>

 * </div>

 * <p><code>&lt;resourceIdentifier&gt;</code> consists of several
 * segments, specified as follows.</p>

 * <p><code>[localePrefix/][libraryName/][libraryVersion/]resourceName[/resourceVersion]</code></p>

 * <p class="changed_modified_2_0_rev_a">None of the segments in the
 * resourceIdentifier may be relative paths, such as
 * &#8216;../otherLibraryName&#8217;.  The implementation is not
 * required to support the <code>libraryVersion</code> and
 * <code>resourceVersion</code> segments for the JAR packaging case.</p>

 * <p>Note that <em>resourceName</em> is the only required segment.</p>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p class="javadocSection">Encoding Resources</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *  <p>During the handling of view requests, the JSF run-time may be
 *  called upon to encode a resource in such a way as to instruct the
 *  user-agent to make a subsequent resource request.  This behavior is
 *  orchestrated by one of the resource renderers
 *  (<code>ScriptRenderer</code>, <code>StylesheetRenderer</code>,
 *  <code>ImageRenderer</code>), which all call {@link Resource#getRequestPath}
 *  to obtain the encoded URI for the resource.  See {@link
 *  Resource#getRequestPath} and the Standard HTML RenderKit specification for
 *  the complete specification.</p>

 * <p class="changed_added_2_2">This usage of resources does not apply
 * for resources that correspond to VDL resources.</p>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p class="javadocSection">Decoding Resources</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *  <p>During the handling of resource requests, the JSF run-time will
 *  be called upon to decode a resource in such a way as to serve up
 *  the bytes of the resource to the user-agent.  This behavior is
 *  orchestrated by {@link #handleResourceRequest}, which calls {@link
 *  Resource#getInputStream} to obtain bytes of the resource.  See
 *  {@link #handleResourceRequest} for the complete specification.</p>

 * <p class="changed_added_2_2">This usage of resources does not apply
 * for resources that correspond to VDL resources.</p>
