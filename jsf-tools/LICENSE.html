as may be required after delivery to Licensee. <BR>11.3 It is
understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Licensee's breach of the provisions of Section 7 of
this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery
of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be
entitled to seek timely injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights
under this Agreement in addition to any and all remedies available at
law. <BR>11.4 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this
Agreement to an affiliated company. <BR>11.5 This Agreement is the
parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter.&nbsp; It

and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote,
order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties
relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.&nbsp;
No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing
and signed by an authorized representative of each party.</P>
