                <li>3 rows of data should have been rendered. Each row should have the following:</li>
                <li>3 text boxes should have been dynamically added inside the component. The first two should display '1' and '2'. The third should be blank</li>
                <li>The first two boxes will receive an auto-generated id. The third box has had its id set programmatically</li>
                <li>The third box is a required field, so when you click any of the 'POSTback' buttons you should see a 'Value is required' message</li>
