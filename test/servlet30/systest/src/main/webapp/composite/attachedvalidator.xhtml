                Ensure validators are properly re-targeted when the
                target of the validator is nested within another naming
                container.  Note that the value of the 'for' attribute doesn't
                mimic the NamingContainer hierarchy, that's handled by the
                'targets' attribute within the composite:implementation section
                of validator4.xhtml.
