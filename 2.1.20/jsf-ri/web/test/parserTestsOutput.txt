# Note! The parser is a modified JSP 2.0 parser that uses the JSP
# delimiters rather than the JSF delimiters. 
#
# Even though the JSP spec states that only a single expression must
# be parsable, the Apache Jakarta Commons EL parser used by Jasper2
# handles parsing and evaluation of mixed literal and expression values
# as well. While the JSF RI uses a modified version of the Commons EL parser,
# it's only used for single expressions; mixed literal/expression
# values are handled by the MixedELValueBinding class instead.
# Hence, all mixed literal/expression tests have been moved to
# the evaluationTests test case for JSF
