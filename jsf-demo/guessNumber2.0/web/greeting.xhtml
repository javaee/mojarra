        Take a quick look at the Facelet page.  Notice that there is no script
        or link references as children of &lt;h:head&gt;.  These resources
        leverage the new event system introduced in JSF 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
        The script resource is generated when the Validator is added to the
        UIInput.  The external stylesheet reference is referenced by Facelet tag
        within the form, but is utimately rendered in the head.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, enter a non-digit character into the input field and change focus.
        Notice a JS Alert is present stating the input is not correct.
        The inputText definition in the Facelet page has no onmouseout definiton,
        but the generated source does.  This is accomplished by the custom Validator
        listening for a BeforeRenderEvent being triggered by the inputText component.
        When the Validator listener method is invoked, it adds the necessary javascript
        information to the input component.
    </p>
    <p>
        The resource system is put to work in other ways as well.  Notice that in
        the Facelet pages, the image URLs are generated via expressions instead of
        graphicImage components.
